      <h2>Monthly Instalment Payment/debit</h2>
      <p>
        Once you subscribe on the Website, you will be required to choose your
        mode of payment either through card or online transfer. You will also
        have the option to choose whether you want to be automatically debited
        monthly or you wish to make payment manually every time payment is due.
        Where you opt for manual payment, it is your responsibility to ensure
        that you do not fall into default, in order to avoid incurring default
        charges. We will equally try to remind you before the monthly deadline
        to ensure that you are well notified in a bid to forestall any default.
      </p>
      <h2>Duration of Payment</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your choice, we have a payment plan that spans between 1 -3
        years with varying prices. You are at liberty to subscribe at different
        times within the payment window. Each subscription shall be treated
        separately and the delivery date calculated from the date we receive the
        first instalment.

          10% of your monthly subscription for the two(2) months that you

          property;
